        <hr>
        <p>Willi Sänger grew up in Berlin, completing a business degree and working as a clerk until the start of WWI, when he was enlisted to fight as a solider in the German Army. <br>Rejecting his original political membership in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany" target="_blank">Social Democratic Party of Germany</a>          because of their support of WWI, he changed his allegiance first to the left-centrist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany" target="_blank">USPD</a> and finally to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany" target="_blank">German Communist Party</a>          in 1919.</p>

        <p>Sänger was an avid athlete, internationally competing as a high jumper. He chaired and founded various anti-fascist sports organizations which promoted physical wellness, a love of the outdoors, and unity against political rivals. In the 1920s,
          he became chairman of the workers' sports club "spruce" in Berlin -Südost and from 1928 he was a functionary of the fighting community of Red sports unit , the communist counterpart to the Workers Sports and Gymnastics Union .</p>

        <p>During World War II, Willi Sänger worked extensively for the Communist Party. On their behalf he put together reports indicating the political mood of the population. From about 1938, Willi Sänger was a member of Robert Uhrig's resistance group.
          After their defeat in 1942, he joined the Schumann-Engert-Kresse Group - the largest Nazi resistance group in the German Communist Party. He was able to obtain and spread a copy of the Gestapo’s "Wanted List", saving some of his fellow opposition
          fighters from death.</p>

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Sänger's anti-Nazi organization was betrayed by an informant in early July 1944, and he was arrested on 6 July 1944. On 21 October 1944, he was sentenced to death by beheading by the People's Court. </p>

        <p>His execution was carried out on 27 November 1944 at the Brandenburg-Görden Prison. He is buried in the central cemetery / Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin. In East Germany, Willi-Sänger is the namesake of many sports groups, schools,
          and streets - including the one on which I live!</p>
